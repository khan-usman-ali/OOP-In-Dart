This is a small traffic signal light system in which we will change the light colour after some duration.We have following classes in this system.

1-TrafficLight class
2-Main class

1- Traffic Light class

In this traffic light class we have two properties name as 
color and duration which are encapsulated. We will set and get the color and duration properties through setColor and getColor and setDuration and getDuration method. Then we have a changeColor method in which we check the existing color of light using if statement then we will use the asynch programing and use the future function with dealy property and then change the color.

2- Main class

 First we will create the instance of traffic light claas.Then we will set the color and duration of traffic through set method. And at the end we will call the changelight method.
